The aim of this project is to develop a web platform for City's Building Material Stock using AI. The project was created for the Urban Mining research design studio @ IAAC where the students can use the platform to extract building materials information and integrate that with other 3D and GIS modeling environments.

#### Front End
The collaborative platform's front end has been developed using a client-server web application architecture to facilitate communication between the compiled material dataset and the web platform front-end interface which visualize data on the browser and receive search parameters from users. This workflow was developed using Mapbox, Openstreetmaps, Javascript, Python.

The geometrical representation of analytical data can vary and be shaped in multiple formats such as vector layers, images, 3D interactive model, charts, and statistical data for the material percentages as a result from the GAN model. These different layers and data are being stored on the server and could be requested using Mapbox and Javascript.

The user interaction takes place on the platform interface that consists of two main parts corresponding to the associated activities: A main wide layout that shows the map plus the Geojson file, and a side bar that shows statistical data plus raster images. This simple interface affords a higher level of communication between the user and the prototype.
